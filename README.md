This is a simple task to create a React stock ticker app with an integrated API. The instructions are simple, so feel free to put the amount of effort you deem reasonable for this task!

Requirements
A user can type in a stock ticker (Ex: TSLA) and it displays a list of tickers matching with the input, in real time

The input can be typed partially and display relevant results(Ex: TS should show the Tesla stock)
The input can also be the name of the company (Ex: Tes should show Tesla stock)
Optional: The price of each stock is listed
A user can select a ticker from the list

When selected, it displays the name of the ticker with the change since last day
